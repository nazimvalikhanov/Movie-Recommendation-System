# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **hybrid movie recommendation system** that combines  
**Content-Based Filtering** (using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity) and  
**Collaborative Filtering** (using ALS from the Implicit library) to suggest movies based on user preferences.

## 💻 Tech Stack Used in This Project

- 🐍 Python (`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Implicit`, `Streamlit`)
- 🔍 NLP: TF-IDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity
- 🧠 Collaborative Filtering: ALS (Alternating Least Squares)
- 📦 Pickle (for model saving/loading)
- 📊 Streamlit (for UI deployment)

## 📁 Data & Models

> ⚠️ Due to GitHub's file size limit, some large files such as `movies.csv` and `tfidf_model.pkl` are not included here.  
> If needed, they can be shared upon request or made accessible via an external link.
